# Valid Cast

_Valid Cast_ combines input validation with type casting. Developers are sometimes forced to make assumptions about the
input data type. Assumptions can be dangerous, because one can easily overlook corner cases. Input validation can help
to gain confidence about the data type as well as semantic correctness of the input value.
